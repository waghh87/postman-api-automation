# Postman API Automation Integration with GitHub Actions

This repository is a demonstration POC for integrating **Postman tests** with **GitHub Actions**.  
The tests are written in **Postman** and executed on a **VM** using **Newman** and **newman-reporter-htmlextra**.  
GitHub Actions triggers the project execution on every push to the **main branch**, and it can also be triggered manually using **workflow_dispatch**.  
Additionally, the project is scheduled to run automatically using a **cron job**.

The **HTML report** is archived and available in the **Artifacts** section for the team to download.  
You can also view the latest report directly from the GitHub Pages site:  
👉 [https://virajkolekar.github.io/Phoenix-Inwarranty-Flow/](https://virajkolekar.github.io/Phoenix-Inwarranty-Flow/)  
The latest report is also emailed to team members using **Gmail SMTP**.
